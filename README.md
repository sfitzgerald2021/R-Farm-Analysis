# R-Farm-Analysis
This project analyzes survey data collected from students, faculty, staff, and community members to understand preferences and satisfaction with local farm produce. Using R and R Markdown, I explored customer attitudes toward produce quality, amount, and variety, and provided data-driven recommendations to guide farm management decisions.
