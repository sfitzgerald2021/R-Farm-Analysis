# Sustainable Farm Analysis

This project analyzes survey data collected from students, faculty, staff, and community members to understand preferences and satisfaction with local farm produce. Using **R** and **R Markdown**, I explored customer attitudes toward produce **quality, amount, and variety**, and provided data-driven recommendations to guide farm management decisions.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Summary Statistics**: Processed survey responses and generated descriptive statistics for produce quality, amount, and variety.
- **Customer Satisfaction Analysis**: Found that quality was the top driver of satisfaction, with most respondents rating produce as *“Very Satisfied”*.
- **Product Preferences**: Identified that vegetables and fruits were most popular, while herbs and flowers showed moderate demand.
- **Statistical Testing**: Conducted Chi-Square and Fisher’s Exact tests to examine relationships between produce preferences, satisfaction, and purchasing behavior.
- **Visualization**: Created bar charts and frequency plots to highlight demand patterns (e.g., top requested produce items such as fruits, potatoes, cucumbers, and carrots).
- **Actionable Recommendations**:
  - Maintain and enhance produce quality to sustain satisfaction.
  - Expand fruit and vegetable offerings, especially staple items.
  - Increase variety and specialty produce to appeal to niche preferences.
  - Encourage customers to rely on the market for a greater portion of their household produce.
